# hello-world
this repo is just getting started...
I've been swept up in the data science hype, so I'm learning to code.
Well, I already knew how to code, sort of. I took 'Introduction to Scientific Programming' in college, where I used Mathmatica and some version of C. I also worked with MATLAB and LabVIEW in grad school while I was running a spectroscopy experiement.
But now I'm making a more systematic study, with the aim of gaining acceptance to the Metis Data Science Bootcamp. And beyond that, riches beyond my wildest imagination and a job that never gets boring or difficult. Okay, I guess that's a bit much. But I do want some job that's better paying and more interesting than driving Uber.
